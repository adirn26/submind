# SubMind – Speak to Your Data, Anywhere

SubMind is a multi-agent system that allows users to query **any database** — MongoDB, PostgreSQL, and more — using **natural language**. Built using **Google’s Agent Development Kit (ADK)** and **Gemini Flash**, it abstracts away complex querying, schema knowledge, and DB-specific syntax.

Whether you're a business user, analyst, or developer — just ask your question, and SubMind handles the rest.
